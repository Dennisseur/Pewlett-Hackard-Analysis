# Pewlett Packard Analysis

## The HR Department at Pewlett Hackard wants to setup a mentorship program for employees. To do this needed us to identify the number of retiring employees by title and identify the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program. 

•	Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

•	Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

•	Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

## Software
•	PostgreSQL pgAdmin

•	Visual Studio Code

## Results:
Retiring by Title:
•	Of the 300,024 employees within the company, 90,398 are eligible for retirement.
•	Titles with most retirees are list below and combined they account for 64% of all positions eligible for retirements
o	Senior Engineers - 29414
o	Senior Staff – 28254 

Eligible for the Mentorship Program:
•	There are 1,940 employees eligible for the mentorship program that were born between 1/1/1965 & 12/31/1965

## Summary:
Pewlett Hackard has approximately 90,000 employees available for retirement. That is about 30% of its overall employee count of 300,024. They only have a handful of employees that are eligible for the mentorship program based on the age requirements. 

Suggestion – Pewlett Packard should adjust the age requirement for mentees to allow more staff to train new employees. This could minimize the impact of a large turnover in the future.
